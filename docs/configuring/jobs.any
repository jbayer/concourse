\title{\code{jobs}\aux{: Plans to execute against resources}}{configuring-jobs}

\reference{jobs}{Jobs} determine the \italic{actions} of your pipeline, how
resources progress through it, and how everything is visualized. They are
listed under the \code{jobs} key in the pipeline configuration.

The following example defines a simple unit-level job that will trigger
whenever new code arrives at the \code{concourse} resource:

\codeblock{yaml}{
jobs:
- name: atc-unit
  plan:
  - get: concourse
  - task: unit
    file: concourse/ci/atc.yml
}

Each configured job consists of the following attributes:

\define{name}{string}{
  \italic{Required.} The name of the job. This should be short; it will show up
  in URLs.
}

\define{serial}{boolean}{
  \italic{Optional. Default \code{false}.} If set to \code{true}, builds will
  queue up and execute one-by-one, rather than executing in parallel.
}

\define{serial_groups}{[string]}{
  \italic{Optional. Default \code{[]}.} When set to an array of arbitrary
  tag-like strings, builds of this job and other jobs referencing the same
  tags will be serialized.

  This can be used to ensure that certain jobs do not run at the same time,
  like so:

  \codeblock{yaml}{
  jobs:
  - name: job-a
    serial_groups: [some-tag]
  - name: job-b
    serial_groups: [some-tag, some-other-tag]
  - name: job-c
    serial_groups: [some-other-tag]
  }

  In this example, \code{job-a} and \code{job-c} can run concurrently, but
  neither job can run builds at the same time as \code{job-b}.

  The builds are executed in their order of creation, across all jobs with
  common tags.
}

\define{public}{boolean}{
  \italic{Optional. Default \code{false}.} If set to \code{true}, the build log
  of this job will be viewable by unauthenticated users. Unauthenticated users
  will always be able to see the inputs, outputs, and build status history of a
  job. This is useful if you would like to expose your pipeline publicly without
  showing sensitive information in the build log.
}

\define{plan}{[step]}{
  \italic{Required.} The \reference{build-plans}{Build Plan} to execute.
}
